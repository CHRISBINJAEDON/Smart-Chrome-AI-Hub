## 🌟 Vision & Purpose

Smart Chrome AI Hub is a student-led platform that enables youth to build AI-powered web applications and Chrome Extensions—without servers, without internet, and without compromising privacy. By harnessing Google Chrome AI APIs like Gemini Nano, the Hub delivers a future-ready, client-side solution aligned with key UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

- Quality Education (SDG 4)
- Gender Equality (SDG 5)
- Climate Action (SDG 13)
- Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10)
- Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11)
